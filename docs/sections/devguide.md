## Introduction

### Architecture Overview

Rarecips is a Single Page Application (SPA) web application that follows a three-tier architecture consisting of:

- **Client (Frontend):** Angular dynamic SPA providing the user interface
- **Server (Backend):** Spring Boot REST API that handles business logic and data processing
- **Database:** MySQL database for persistent data storage

Angular will serve SPA content dynamically by displaying data obtained through backend API requests, which load information from database.

### Architecture Summary

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Type** | Web SPA with REST API |
| **Technologies** | Angular, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Docker |
| **Tools** | VSCode, WebStorm, Postman, Maven, npm, Docker, Git |
| **Quality Control** | Unit testing (JUnit), Integration testing, System testing
| **Deployment** | Docker containers, CI/CD with GitHub Actions |
| **Development Process** | Iterative and incremental, Git workflow, DevOps practices |

## Technologies

### Frontend Technologies

#### Angular (https://angular.io/)
Modern TypeScript-based framework for building scalable single-page applications. Used for creating the entire user interface and managing client-side routing, state management, and user interactions.

### Backend Technologies

#### Spring Boot (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
Java-based framework for building production-ready applications with minimal configuration. Used for creating REST APIs, handling business logic, security, and data persistence.

#### Java (https://www.oracle.com/java/)
Object-oriented programming language used for backend development, providing robustness, security, and platform independence.

#### MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/)
Relational database management system used for storing application data including users, recipes, reviews, and ingredients.

### Infrastructure Technologies

#### Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
Containerization platform used for packaging the application and its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers for consistent deployment across environments.

#### GitHub Actions (https://github.com/features/actions)
CI/CD platform integrated with GitHub for automating testing, building, and deployment workflows.

## Tools

### Development Environments

#### Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Lightweight code editor used primarily for frontend development with Angular and TypeScript, offering excellent extensions for web development.

#### WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
Professional IDE used for advanced JavaScript/TypeScript development, providing intelligent code assistance and debugging capabilities.

#### IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
Professional Java IDE used for backend development with Spring Boot, offering advanced code analysis and debugging tools.

### Build and Package Management

#### Maven (https://maven.apache.org/)
Build automation and project management tool used for managing Java dependencies, compiling, testing, and packaging the Spring Boot application.

#### npm (https://www.npmjs.com/)
Package manager for Node.js used for managing frontend dependencies and running build scripts for the Angular application.

### Version Control and Collaboration

#### Git (https://git-scm.com/)
Distributed version control system used for tracking code changes and collaboration.

#### GitHub (https://github.com/)
Cloud-based Git repository hosting service used for code storage, issue tracking, and project management.

## Architecture

### Deployment Architecture

```

**Communication Protocols:**
- Frontend ↔ Backend: HTTP/HTTPS REST API + WebSockets for real-time notifications
- Backend ↔ Database: JDBC connections for data persistence

### REST API Documentation

The complete API documentation is available in OpenAPI format and can be viewed at [Rarecips API Documentation](https://raw.githack.com/codeurjc-students/2025-Rarecips/main/docs/api/api-docs.html)

## Quality Control

### Automated Testing

#### Frontend Testing
- **Framework:** Selenium + JUnit
- **Types:** Unit tests for components and services, Integration tests for user workflows, System tests for UI
- **Applies to:** Recipes

#### Backend Testing  
- **Framework:** JUnit 5 and Spring Boot Test
- **Types:** Unit tests for services and repositories, Integration tests for REST endpoints, System tests for database
- **Applies to:** Recipes

#### Test Statistics
*Test metrics will be updated as development progresses*

## Development Process

### Agile Methodology

The project follows an iterative and incremental development process based on Agile principles and incorporating best practices from Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban methodologies.

#### Task Management
- **GitHub Issues:** Used for tracking bugs, features, and improvements
- **GitHub Projects:** Kanban-style board for visual task management and sprint planning
- **Labels and Milestones:** Organized by priority, type, and development phases

#### Git Workflow
- **Repository:** Single repository with frontend and backend code
- **Branching Strategy:** Feature branches with pull requests for code review
- **Pull Requesting:** Used for safe merging into main branch to add functional features
- **Commit Standards:** Conventional commits for automated changelog generation

*Git metrics will be updated as development progresses*

#### Continuous Integration
GitHub Actions workflows automate:
- **Build Verification:** Compile and package both frontend and backend
- **Automated Testing:** Run unit and integration tests on pull requests

## Code Execution and Editing

### Repository Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codeurjc-students/2025-Rarecips.git
cd 2025-Rarecips
```

### Execution

#### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- MySQL 8.0+ (or use Docker)

#### Database Setup
```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d mysql

# Or manually configure MySQL with:
# Database: rarecips
# Username: root
# Password: Ask for permission to access repository secret
```

#### Backend Execution
```bash
cd backend
# Install dependencies and run
mvn spring-boot:run

# Backend will be available at http://localhost:8443
```

#### Frontend Execution
```bash
cd frontend
